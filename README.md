## Build Setup

```bash

Travis CI should now be up and running

Dockerhub should do autobuilds now on push as well

# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
